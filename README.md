Through this project, I analyzed the sentimental/emotional trajectory of the transcripts from Vince Gilligan's celebrated TV show, Breaking Bad. I used NLP techniques to preprocess text, perform sentiment analysis, and visualize results.

Key results include:
- Sentiment distribution of dialogues
- Sentiment trends for main characters
- Emotion intensity changes over seasons
- Frequently used words and their significance
- Sentiment analysis of character interactions
